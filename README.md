# Trust-worthy Bank
Suppose that Alice wants to
store a large amount of money, but does not
want to risk losing everything if her private
key is lost or stolen. She makes a contract
with Bob, a semi-trustworthy bank, with the
following rules: Alice is allowed to withdraw
up to I per day, Alice with Bob's approval
can withdraw any amount, and Bob alone can
withdraw up to 0.05 per day. Normally, Alice
will only need small amounts at a time, and if
Alice wants more she can prove her identity
to Bob and make the withdrawal. If Alice's pri-
vate key gets stolen, she can run to Bob and
move the funds into another contract before
the thief gets away with more than 1 of the
funds. If Alice loses her private key, Bob will
eventually be able to recover her funds. And
if Bob turns out to be evil, Alice can withdraw
her own funds twenty times faster than he
can. In short, all ofthe security of traditional
banking, but with almost none of the trust.
